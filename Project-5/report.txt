a.  This project went relatively smoothly with few obstacles. I at first made a 
    mistake in the setTo() function for PlaneFlight, where I accidentally
    compared the to string against itself as opposed to mFrom. Also, I initially
    forgot to make freeFlight() return false if it is passed invalid parameters
    for from, to, or mileage.

b.  In addition to the provided testing code, I included the following cases:

*   Test PlaneFlight and FrequenFlyerAccount constructors for basic 
    functionality (account balance starts at zero). 
*   Providing invalid values to the contructor should create a PlaneFlight w/
    mName = null, mFrom = null, mTo = null, mileage = -1, cost = -1
*   Test accessors for basic functionality
*   Test mutators for basic functionality
*   Ensure that setting the from city to the same string as the to city does not
    change the from city.
*   PlaneFlight mutators do not store same origin and destination (values should
    remain unchanged).
*   Ensure that adding a non zero cost flight to an account increases account
    balance
*   Ensure that adding a zero cost flight to an account does not increase the
    mileage balance.
*   Ensure canEarnFreeFlight() returns true with a sufficient balance (and
    converse).
*   Ensure creating a free flight with valid parameters reduces mileage balance
    and returns true (and converse)
