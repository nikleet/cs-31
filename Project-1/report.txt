How many Electoral College electors are there? 255
How many of these electors voted for the Republican party candidate? 110
How many of these electors voted for the Democratic party candidate? 150

43.1% of the 255 electors voted for the Republican party candidate.
58.8% of the 255 electors voted for the Democratic party candidate.

Looks like the Democratic party candidate won!
Looks like some of these data values don't make sense.

>> The number of votes is greater than the number of electors. The percentages sum to a value greater than 100 percent.

-------------- Logic Error --------------

Line 27: double pctRepub = ( 100.0 / republicanVotes ) * totalVoters;

Line 28: double pctDemoc = ( 100.0 / democraticVotes ) * totalVoters;


The code calculates the reciprocal of the desired percentage.
The logic error was introduced by exchanging the multiplication 
and division symbols in the two lines above.
